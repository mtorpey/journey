# Journey Through Europe: Legacy (notes) #

Notes for creating an extended version of the game with:
- better balance (initially)
- more options for players
- an evolving game where a session may change the game board/rules permanently

## Clarifications
Some aspects of the original rules are unclear.  These should be made concrete.
- You can stop moving early, or even make no move at all.
- Each player's destinations are public and should be clearly displayed.
- You shouldn't look at the destination instructions in advance
- "Move on x cities" means "Take another turn assuming a roll of x".
- If you roll, you can still choose to do sea travel instead.
- Sea routes are dashed, land routes are solid.  Dover--Calais is a land route.
- Determine dealer randomly
- You don't play for runners up
- Make "back and forth" explicit
- Faroe islands are in Denmark
- Ambiguous card instructions:
  * "next turn" could be the turn you take immediately if you rolled a 6

## Simple improvements
Things that just make the game better, and should probably already be in.  Introduce these early via cards.
- Faster ships: sea routes work the same as land routes, but cost 2 points.
- Drafting destinations: random home, place pins, then several drafts of location cards.
  * A 3-card draft for each colour
  * No looking at destination effects!
- Borders: costs 1 extra point to move between countries

## Big new mechanics
Important features that might dramatically change the game.  Introduce these over time.

### Character cards
- Choose a character each game
- Fun name -- make up names yourself?
- Bound to piece colours
- Special powers
  * One initially
  * More added later
  * Chosen
- Add early: maybe even for game 2

### Event cards
- Stack available on table
- Draw one if you roll a double-6
- Add early

### Global Warming
- Big thermometer on board
- Add a mark each time a player flies
- When the counter reaches 100 (or so) a CO~2~ pocket in Greenland is released
- Many coastal cities are removed from the game
- Replace some routes with sea routes
- Add early

### High Speed Rail
- Permanent special routes added to board
- Faster to move along
  * half a point per move?
- ~~Some restriction: have to stay on until reaching an end?~~
- Initially, each player puts down a length-3 railway
- Expand railways over time
- Special powers:
  * Railroad tycoon: when moving by road away from a rail-connected city, add rail along the first route you take
- Extra event cards:
  * HS3: add a new length-3 railway anywhere in this country (or as long as possible)
  * Leaves on the line: For the rest of the game, moving on railways costs 2 per route instead of ½ per route

### The Iron Curtain
- Countries divided into 3 factions:
  * NATO
  * Warsaw Pact (WP)
  * Non-aligned (incl. Yugoslavia and Albania)
- Small sticker for each country
- Cannot move directly between NATO and WP countries
  * Special case for West Berlin
- If a NATO or WP player wins a game, add 1 to that faction's score
- When a faction's score reaches 3, they win the Cold War

### Fall of Communism
- All WP countries become non-aligned
- Turkey becomes non-aligned
- NATO becomes EU
- No border penalty between EU countries
- Hand in a card in a country bordering two EU countries: roll to join

### Fall of Capitalism
- All NATO countries become non-aligned
- WP becomes Global Communist Utopia (GCU)
- Each player has to visit Moscow in each game as if they had it as a destination card
- At end of game, take all non-aligned cards that were handed in, and pick 2 to be invaded (they become GCU)

### From the Ashes
- The defeated faction may rise again and trigger nuclear war

### Breakup of...
- Choose a random(ish) card - that country has a civil war and begins to break up
- Movement is impaired in the country (lower of two rolls?)
- When a player hands in a card here, they roll a die
  * 6: the war ends
  * otherwise: split this country into two countries
  * equal number of cities (or as close as possible)
  * draw the border in permanent marker
  * both countries are at civil war
  * both countries are non-aligned

### Journey through Africa
- Add cities to North African coast
  * Players add one each - create card (no special event) and add to map
  * Sea routes connecting each one to Europe
- The African Union acts as one country covering the whole continent, and is non-aligned.  Mark it now with "AU" and a yellow sticker.
- One African city dealt to each player with yellow cards
- Extra event cards
  * African Infrastructure: each player adds one road or sea route connecting two African cities
  * African City: make a new city

## New decks
These decks will be added to the game:
- New rules -- sticker for rulesheet, or instruction to open envelope.
- Character abilities -- stickers for character cards.
- Events -- big things that happen

### Character abilities
These are added to characters over time.  Perhaps 1 for each player after a game, but hand out in order of how many destinations you have left.
- (A) **Private yacht**: You may move along the coast by 1 city as if it were a sea route, e.g. Brest to Nantes or Riga to Gdansk
- (A) **Olympian**: You may move immediately to Athens instead of a normal turn.
- (A) **Viking**: You may move immediately to Reykjavík instead of a normal turn.
- (A) **Chef**: You may move immediately to Paris instead of a normal turn.
- (A) **Hare**: Rolls of 5 or 6 are doubled, but rolls of 1--4 count for 0.
- (A) **Tortoise**: Ignore and reroll all 6s, but get an extra turn when you roll a 1.
- (A) **Black cat**: If you roll a 1, you may ignore it and reroll.
- (A) **Dora**: If you roll a 5 or 6, you get an extra turn.
- (A) **Commander**: If you roll a 1, make your move and then move another player 1 city by road (ignoring any movement penalties).

- (A) **Diplomat**: You can move between NATO and WP countries.
- (A) **Flygskam**: Add 2 to all rolls, but you cannot fly.
- (A) **Seasick**: You cannot travel by sea, but you can fly to Ajaccio, Cagliari, Faeroe and Shetland.
- (A) **Lonely backpacker**: Whenever you are in the same city as another player (even passing through), you must stop immediately and follow that player for their next 2 turns, missing your own 2 turns on those rounds.
- (A) **Late planner**: When handing in your 5th destination, you may trade one destination card to the bank for a random one of the same colour.
- (A) **Brit abroad**: Whenever you are in the same city as another player (even passing through), challenge that player to fight: each player rolls the die, and the lower roll loses and misses their next turn.
- (A) **Revolutionary**: Once per game, you may change the faction of the country you are in to that of a neighbouring country.
- (A) **True Neutral**: Once per game, you may change the faction of the country you are in to "non-aligned" (not the Soviet Union).
- (A) **Off-duty pilot**: You may make one free flight per game.
- (A) **Cuckoo**: Whenever you are in the same city as another player (even passing through), you can kick that player out to any neighbouring city.
- (A) **Speedboat salesman**: You may end your turn in a flooded city.
- (A) **Lover**: Whenever you are in the same city as another player (even passing through), that player follows you for this and your next turn, missing their own turns in these rounds.
- (A) **Rockstar**: Before rolling for your movement, you may choose to double your roll.  You move, but the player to your left then rolls and moves for you, before taking their own turn.

- ~~Hipster: you cannot end your turn anywhere that someone else has previously (in this game) ended theirs~~
- ~~**American tourist**: you cannot end consecutive turns in the same country~~

### Event cards

- (E) **Independence**: Choose one of the following countries to become independent:
