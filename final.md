# Journey Through Europe: Legacy #

This document contains instructions for preparing a "legacy" version of the board game _Journey Through Europe_.  By "legacy", we mean an extended version of the game that changes each time you play, permanently affecting the rules, board and story.

Preparation mainly consists of writing cards and labels and sealing them in envelopes for the players to open at the appropriate times.  The rules are not revealed to players at the beginning, but are added gradually over about 10 games.

If you want to play without spoilers, **stop reading now**.  Ask a friend who doesn't want to play, or who doesn't care about spoilers, to follow these instructions for you.



## What you'll need ##
- 1 copy of _Journey Through Europe_
    - These instructions are based on the most common version, published by Ravensburger in the early 1980s, in a yellow-and-blue box, easily available on eBay
- Blank white cards
- Lots of 64mmÃ—34mm labels
- Red, blue, yellow and green stickers (little round ones)

    - Each envelope includes an **Instruction sheet**, which will be an A4 or A5 sheet with instructions to the player.  Print this sheet verbatim, but where you see quote sections, these should be printed onto labels stuck to the page with double-sided sticky tape, so that players can peel them off and stick them to the Rules Sheet.
    - Each envelope may also contain some cards or other components, which should be included as well (usually in a plastic bag so players don't look at them straight away).
    - Cards to be included will start with (R) or (E) or (A), denoting what type of card they are...

## Introduction ##
_(Print on A5 and put at the top, so it's the first thing players see when they open the box)_

_Journey Through Europe: Legacy_

A game for 3--6 players

This box contains everything you need to play _Journey Through Europe: Legacy_, a customised version of the original board game _Journey Through Europe_ that changes each time you play, permanently affecting the rules, board and story.

You may want to play multiple times with the same group of players; however, if some players leave or new players join between games, this shouldn't be a problem.  The game should be playable with only 2 players, but 3--6 is recommended.  The full saga should last around 12 games, and you will be left with a dramatically changed game, and a board quite different from anything Ravensburger intended.

New rules and features will be introduced over time through the envelopes that are included.  When you open an envelope, read the instructions on the folded piece of paper inside, but don't look at anything else unless instructed to!

Start by reading the original rules and playing a game of _Journey Through Europe_.  As soon as you're finished, write the name of the winner on the Rules sheet, then open Envelope A and follow the instructions inside!



## Clarifications ##
_(Print on A5 and include next to original rulebook)_

Some of the original rules of _Journey Through Europe_ are a little unclear.  We've made some of the ambiguities clear, so that in the Legacy version you always know exactly what you're supposed to be doing.  If anything is unclear, check below:
- A "route" will be defined as a single line linking 2 cities on the board (not passing through any others).
- You can stop moving before moving the full number you rolled, or even make no move at all.
- Your destination cards are public and should be clearly displayed.
- You shouldn't look at the instructions on your destination cards until you reach the destination.
- "Move on x cities" means "Take another turn assuming a roll of x".
- If you roll, you can still choose to do sea travel instead.
- Sea routes are dashed, land routes are solid.  Dover--Calais is a land route.
- The dealer is determined randomly.
- You don't play for runners up, you just finish when the first person finishes.
- "not backwards and forwards in the same go": if a player follows a route, they may not follow it in the opposite direction until their next turn.
- If you roll a six, your extra turn counts as a brand new turn.
- You may hand in a destination card just by passing through the city, without stopping; only on _places of interest_ do you have to stop moving.
- The Faroe islands are in Denmark.

## Envelope A ##
### Instructions sheet ###
_New Rules_

Europe has never stood still, and neither do the rules of _Journey Through Europe: Legacy_.  Included in this envelope are several Rules cards.  Don't look at these cards yet!  Shuffle them (gently) and keep them available as a deck.

At various times, you will draw new Rules cards from the deck, and carry out their instructions.  This will usually include adding new rules to the Rules sheet (included in the box) by sticking a label to it.  Rules that are visible on the Rules sheet are additional rules that you have to follow when playing.

Start by sticking the following label to the Rules sheet:
> At the end of each game, draw one Rules cards from the deck (if there is one), follow its instructions, and then destroy it.

To get you started, draw **two** Rules cards right now, follow their instructions, and destroy them.

### Cards to include ###
- (R) **Faster ships**: Sea routes work the same as land routes, but cost 2 points.
- (R) **Drafting destinations**: Instead of dealing destinations randomly, distribute them with 3 drafts.
  - Determine home cities as normal.
  - Deal 3 red cards to each player: each player chooses one and passes the rest to their left, repeatedly until each player has chosen 3 cards.
  - Do the same for green cards, and then for yellow.
  - No looking at the instructions on the backs of cards!
- (R) **Borders**: Moving from one country to another costs 1 additional movement point (even on ships and planes).
- (R) **Characters**: Open Envelope J.  Destroy this card.
- (R) **Footprint**: Open Envelope G.  Destroy this card.



## Envelope J ##
### Instructions sheet ###
_Characters_

No two travellers are the same, and from now on you will play as unique characters that gain traits as your story progresses.

First, this envelope contains some Rules cards.  Shuffle them carefully into the deck of Rules cards, without looking at them.  This envelope also contains some Special Ability cards: shuffle them (gently) without looking at them, and keep them available as a deck.

Next, examine the Character Sheets included in this envelope.  Take the one that corresponds to your piece colour from the last game, and give the character a name.

Stick the following labels to your Rules sheet:
> At the beginning of each game, each player chooses a character, clockwise starting with the player to the left of the dealer (do this after home cities are determined, but before other destinations are distributed).  This character determines your special abilities and piece colour for the game.

> If you have more players than usual, you may need to create a new character.  If it is your turn to choose a character, but all Character Sheets have already been chosen, take an unused Character Sheet from the box, give it a name, and take Special Abilities equal to the number on each other character, plus one.  Choose one card to return to the deck, and stick the rest to the new Character Sheet.

> At the end of each _even-numbered_ game, draw and reveal a number of Special Ability cards equal to the number of players in the game.  Each player chooses one and sticks it to their Character Sheet.

> The order is determined by how many destination cards remain in the players' hand, starting with the player with the most cards and finishing with the player that has won the game and therefore has zero.

> If some players have the same number, priority goes to the player whose home is furthest north.  Any unused characters for this game get an extra Special Ability from the deck at random.

> Characters may only have 4 special abilities.  If you already have 4, then choose new Special Abilities as normal, but players may choose to either stick their new ability over an old one, or to return it to the deck unused.

> If there are fewer Special Abilities in the deck than players, then do not take new Special Abilities.

If this was an even-numbered game, then take new Special Ability cards as described now!

- (A) **Cuckoo**: Whenever you are in the same city as another player (even passing through), you can kick that player out to any neighbouring city.

## Envelope I ##
### Instructions sheet
_Events_

Sometimes when travelling, unexpected things happen.  Whatever plans you make, you can count on something going wrong, and this game is no different!

This envelope contains a whole load of Event cards.  Don't look at these just yet, but shuffle them and put them in a pile next to the board face-down.  Add the following labels to the Rules Sheet:

> If a player rolls a 6, and then when rolling for their extra turn they get another 6, they do not move, but immediately draw and read out an Event card, following its instructions.  Then play passes to the next player.

> Return used Event cards to the bottom of the deck, unless otherwise instructed.

> Shuffle the Event deck at the beginning of each game.

More Event cards may be added as you open other envelopes!

This envelope also contains one Rules card.  Shuffle it carefully into the deck of Rules cards.

- (E) **Holiday Romance**: Fall in love with a player of your choice.  Move to their space now, and remove their home marker.  You will now travel together on your turn and theirs.  To win, you must visit all destinations you both have, and return to your home -- the win is shared!

- (R) **High Speed Rail**: Open Envelope E.  Destroy this card.



## Envelope G ##
### Instructions sheet ###
_Footprint_

Add the following label to the board somewhere over the compass in the Arctic Ocean:

> _(Picture of a thermometer composed of 100 boxes)_ When all boxes are filled, open Envelope O.

And add the following label to the Rules Sheet:

> Each time a player takes a flight, fill in one box with initials identifying that player's character. [G]



## Envelope O ##
### Instructions sheet ###
_Global Warming_

Now you've done it.

Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, fuelled by Western innovations, CO~2~ levels in our atmosphere have been rising.  Scientists have warned for years of the dangers of climate change and rising sea levels, but you did nothing to slow your reckless consumption of fossil fuels.  Now rising temperatures have caused a huge CO~2~ pocket in the Greenland ice sheet to open, and what was happening gradually has now happened all at once.  The world will never be the same.

Look through the red destination cards that aren't in use at the moment, examining them one at a time, until you have found 5 coastal cities.  Do this again for yellow, and then for green, so that you have a total of 15 coastal cities.  Tear all these cards in half, and remove them from the game permanently.  Using a permanent marker, draw a black cross through each of these cities on the game board.  All these cities are now underwater, and are completely inaccessible.

Add the following labels to the Rules Sheet:

> No player may stop in a city that is flooded (marked with a cross).

> All roads entering a flooded city are now considered sea routes, and any railways on the route are unusable.

> You may only travel through a flooded city if you have enough movement points to move into it and back out of it again, via sea routes, on the same turn.  You may not fly to a flooded city.

Any player currently in a flooded city evacuates to the nearest unflooded city.

Examine the boxes on the thermometer to see which character took the most flights.  Stick the following label to their Character Sheet, in the area marked "Leave this area blank":
> **Polluter**: Each time you move into a city adjacent to a flooded city, roll a die: on a 1, the inhabitants attack you and you skip the rest of your turn.

All players vote on which of the following two labels should be added to the Rules Sheet over the label marked [G]:

> Each player may take only one flight per game.

> Each time a player takes a flight, they must draw one additional destination card which they must fulfil before completing the game.

Stick the most popular one to the sheet, and destroy the other.  If the vote is tied, choose randomly.

Shuffle the enclosed Special Ability card into the Special Ability deck, without looking at it.

### Cards to include ###
- (A) **Speedboat salesman**: You may end your turn in a flooded city.



## Envelope E ##
### Instructions sheet ###
_High Speed Rail_

If God had meant for us to fly, he never would have given us the railways.  As newer, more efficient engines are invented, and the infrastructure of Europe develops to become more connected, a new generation of high-speed railways is appearing, and making flight almost obselete for short-to-medium distances.

Right now, each player should look at their home city, and choose a path starting at that city that follows 3 road routes.  For example, if your home city is Paris, you might choose the route Paris--Dijon--Lyons--Marseilles.  Build a railway on your chosen route, by using a permanent marker to cross it with several short perpendicular lines, like this:



Now stick the following label to the Rules Sheet:

> Moving along a rail route (crossed with black lines) costs only half a point of movement.

Add the enclosed cards to the Event deck and Special Abilities deck as appropriate.

### Cards to include ###
- (A) **Railroad tycoon**: When moving by road away from a rail-connected city, add rail along the first route you take.

- (E) **HS3**: Add a new length-3 railway anywhere in this country (or as long as possible).
- (E) **Leaves on the line**: For the rest of the game, moving along a rail route costs 2 movement points instead of half a movement point.  This applies to everyone.
- (E) **Tour de France**: Cost of all road movement in France is doubled, and French railways are unusable, for the rest of the game.  The first player to travel from Strasbourg to Marseilles to Bordeaux to Paris, all by road, may hand in up to 3 destination cards for free (not their home city).
- (E) **French Train Drivers' Strike**: Any rail routes that are connected to France by rail are unusable for the rest of the game.  They act as normal roads.

_The Iron Curtain_

"From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent.  Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe."

--- Winston Churchill, 1946

In the winter of 1982, Europe is a continent divided.  In the East, the spectre of Communism looms large; the Warsaw Pact has solidified the dominance of Marxist--Leninist doctrine, and formalised Moscow's tight control over its puppet states.  In the West, the combined forces of capitalist democracy, backed by the US, have formed a nuclear treaty known as NATO, in order to project their own power, and to stop any more nations falling to revolution or the Red Army.  Only a few states remain neutral, and have formed the Non-Aligned Movement in order to commit themselves to peace, and thus preserve their independence.  A tense state of Cold War has existed for decades.

Every country on the board is now part of one of three factions: NATO, the Warsaw Pact (WP), and "non-aligned".  Take the stickers included in this envelope, and stick one on the board right next to each oval-shaped country code, using the following factions:
- NATO (blue):
  - B (Belgium)
  - D (West Germany)
  - DK (Denmark)
  - F (France)
  - GB (United Kingdom)
  - GR (Greece)
  - I (Italy)
  - IS (Iceland)
  - L (Luxembourg)
  - N (Norway)
  - NL (Netherlands)
  - P (Portugal)
  - TR (Turkey)
- WP (red):
  - BG (Bulgaria)
  - CS (Czechoslovakia)
  - DDR (East Germany)
  - H (Hungary)
  - PL (Poland)
  - R (Romania)
  - SU (Soviet Union)
- Non-aligned (yellow):
  - A (Austria)
  - AL (Albania)
  - CH (Switzerland)
  - E (Spain)
  - IRL (Ireland)
  - S (Sweden)
  - SF (Finland)
  - YU (Yugoslavia)

Stick the following labels to the Rules Sheet:

> Each country belongs to a faction denoted by its coloured sticker: blue for NATO, red for WP, and yellow for non-aligned. [B]

> You may not move directly between NATO countries and WP countries.  This includes flights and sea routes. [B]

> **Exception**: You may fly from West Germany to Berlin, but must then fly back to West Germany before any further movement. [B]

Add the following label to the board somewhere over the compass in the Arctic Ocean:

> _(2 columns of 3 boxes, the left one marked with a dollar $, and the right one marked with a hammer-and-sickle â˜­)_

And add the following label to the Rules Sheet:

> At the end of each game, if the winner's home was in a NATO or WP country, put a cross in the corresponding column on the board.  If all 3 NATO ($) boxes are filled, open Envelope Q.  If all 3 WP (â˜­) boxes are filled, open Envelope K. [B]

Shuffle the enclosed cards into the appropriate decks, without looking at them.

### Cards to include ###
Write the letter "B" somewhere subtle on the back of each of the Special Ability and Event cards.

- (A) **Diplomat**: You can move between NATO and WP countries.
- (A) **Revolutionary**: Once per game, you may change the faction of the country you are in to that of a neighbouring country.
- (A) **True Neutral**: Once per game, you may change the faction of the country you are in to "non-aligned" (not the Soviet Union).

- (E) **Swiss Imports**: This country becomes non-aligned.  If it was already non-aligned, choose a neighbouring country to become non-aligned as well.
- (E) **Communist Revolution**: This country joins the Warsaw Pact.  If it was already WP, choose a neighbouring country to become WP as well.

- (R) **Journey Through Africa**: Open Envelope L.  Destroy this card.

_(include all the blue, red, yellow stickers in this envelope)_



## Envelope Q ##
### Instructions sheet ###
_The Fall of Communism_

After 45 years of cold war with the United States and NATO, the Eastern Bloc is exhausted.  The centralised economy, spiralling military spending, and a failure to keep up with the West technologically have created the backdrop to the collapse of an empire.  Beginning with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the people of Eastern Europe rise up, and one by one, the states of the Warsaw Pact fall to popular revolution.  Even the Soviet Union itself faces collapse, as communism loses the breath in its lungs, and democracy and free-market capitalism finally dominate the continent.  In the post-Soviet world, NATO's relevance begins to wane, as a new European structure emerges: the European Union.

The Warsaw Pact no longer exists.  All WP countries immediately become non-aligned -- add yellow stickers to them now.  Turkey also becomes non-aligned -- add a yellow sticker to it too.

Blue stickers now denote EU members, while yellow stickers denote non-members.

Stick the following labels to the Rules Sheet, covering all the labels marked with [B]:
> Each country belongs to a faction denoted by its coloured sticker: blue for EU, and yellow for non-EU.

> There is no border penalty for moving between EU countries.

> Each time you hand in a destination card in a non-EU country that borders at least one EU country, roll a die: on a 6, this country joins the EU.

> _(One blank label)_

Shuffle the enclosed Event cards into Event deck, without looking at them.  Destroy all Event and Special Ability cards with a letter "B" on the back.

### Cards to include ###
- (E) **Rogue State**: Open Envelope D.  Destroy this card.
- (E) **Exit**: This country leaves the EU.  Stick a yellow sticker on it.  If it was already non-EU, choose an EU country to leave.
- (E) **Brexit**: The UK votes to leave the EU.  Either put a yellow sticker on it, or ignore the will of the people and take another Event card.
- (E) **Capitalism is Unfair**: Whoever has fewest destination cards gives one to another player.  In case of a tie, all tied players do so.


## Envelope K ##
### Instructions sheet ###
_The Fall of Capitalism_

After 45 years of cold war against the Eastern Bloc, the West is exhausted.  Market chaos, spiralling military spending, and a failure to keep up with the Soviets in living standards have created the backdrop to the fall of an ideology.  Socialist parties across the West have made unprecedented gains, and desparate attempts to crush the left wing have only turned the people further against the establishment.  General strikes have taken hold across Western Europe, bringing government after government to their knees.  Even the United States has been forced to capitulate to Communist elements from within, and its very existence is uncertain as civil unrest causes several states to begin to secede.  In the chaos, the USSR begins what it calls a peacekeeping mission in Alaska, with the embattled Washington powerless to stop them.

With its superpower gone, NATO is defunct, the market economy is discredited, and democracy itself begins to slip away.  In this post-capitalist Europe, Moscow acts more boldly, and begins to describe the Warsaw Pact openly as what it has always been in secret: a Soviet Empire.

NATO no longer exists.  All NATO countries immediately become non-aligned -- add yellow stickers to them now.

Red stickers now denote the Soviet Empire, while yellow stickers denote the countries that remain non-aligned.

Stick the following labels to the Rules Sheet, covering all the labels marked with [B]:
> Each country belongs to a faction denoted by its coloured sticker: red for members of the Soviet Empire (SE), and yellow for non-aligned countries. 

> In each game, each player whose home is in a SE country must visit Moscow before they can win, as if they have it as an extra destination card.

> At the end of each game, take all the destination cards that were handed in that belong to non-aligned countries.  Pick 2 at random.  These countries are invaded by the Red Army, and join the SE.

> _(One blank label)_

Since this is the end of a game, 2 countries are invaded right now.

Shuffle the enclosed Event cards into the Event deck, without looking at them.

### Cards to include ###
- (E) **Rogue State**: Open Envelope H.  Destroy this card.
- (E) **Redistribution of Wealth**: All destination cards in all players' hands are shuffled together and dealt out clockwise starting to the left of the current player.


## Envelope D
### Instructions sheet ###
_Rogue State_

A regime change in this country has taken the world by surprise.  Nobody expected the recent elections to deliver such radical results, and now hopes of a return to normality have been dashed as extreme paramilitaries sieze the capital in a military coup.  With the alleged support of the people, the new regime declares a state of emergency, executing former leaders, seizing property, and beginning a weapons programme unprecedented in the modern age.  All borders are closed, and foreign governments look on with apprehension.

Put a red sticker on the country you are currently in, replacing its yellow or blue sticker.  Stick the following label to the Rules Sheet:

> A red sticker denotes a Rogue Communist State. [D]

> If a player with their home in a non-EU state hands in a destination card in a Rogue Communist State, that player rolls a die.  If they roll less than __, open Envelope N.
[D]

Fill in the blank on the label with a number computed as follows: 30 divided by the number of cities in this country, rounded up.



## Envelope H
_(As D, but swapping red for blue, Communist for Fascist, etc.)_



## Envelope N
### Instructions sheet ###
_Missile Crisis_

Tensions have been growing between this rogue communist state and its neighbours, and hopes of a nuclear agreement were dashed when a recent summit ended in furious disagreement and threats of war.  Foreign diplomats and journalists have been evacuated, and the rogue government has cut off all communications from this country to the outside world.  EU states have their militaries on high alert, and watch on with bated breath.

Now, without warning, tanks have crossed the border from this country into its neighbour, in a full-blown invasion.  To begin with, the nations of the EU can only watch in amazement.  But as stories emerge of the invaders' brutal efficiency and their weapons plans, the major powers find themselves unable to stay out of the conflict, and their fingers creep slowly towards the red button.

Read these rules fully before taking any actions.

Each player takes the role of a state:
- The player who triggered this envelope takes the role of the rogue state, and chooses a bordering state to invade.
- Any player who is currently in a non-invaded EU state takes the role of that state (unless it contains more than one player).
- Each remaining player chooses any non-invaded EU state they like, going clockwise from the left of the rogue state player.

The rogue player faces off against the allied EU players in a nuclear war.  All players take nuclear weapons tokens (red cubes) from the box as follows:
- The rogue player takes a number equal to the number of players in the game, plus 2.
- Each other player takes 3.

Each player now distributes their weapons among the cities in their country as they choose.  The rogue player may also use cities in the invaded country.

The rogue state and the EU now take turns firing nuclear missiles at each other.  First the rogue player, then an EU player, then the rogue player, and so on.

On a player's turn:
- First, the player chooses one of the weapons in their territory to fire, and removes it from the board.
- They choose a city to fire on, and write it down secretly.
- Each player on the opposing side may now choose to move **one** weapon along a single road or sea route, to another city in their own territory that has not been nuked.
- The attacking player now reveals the city they wrote down, and the missile lands there.
- Put a green sticker on the nuked city.
- If the nuked city contained any weapons, they are destroyed and removed from the board.  The attacking player may hand one destination card (not their home city) to the player who controls the nuked city.
- If the nuked city did not contain a weapon, then this was a misfire.  As compensation, the player who controls the nuked city gets an additional weapon which they may add to any non-nuked city in their country.

Each time it is the EU's turn, a player is chosen randomly from among EU players who still have weapons to use.  This can be done using dice.

If a city containing a player's piece is hit by a missile, they die and their playing piece is moved back to their home city.

The war ends when one side has run out of weapons.

If the rogue player ran out first, then the Rogue Communist State becomes non-aligned.
If the EU ran out first, then put a red sticker on the invaded country, which is now a puppet.
If both sides ran out on the same turn, then neither of these things happens.

Stick the following blank labels over the labels marked [D]:

_Nuclear Fallout_

The world's first nuclear war ended, thankfully, before things went too far.  One side's nuclear arsenal was depleted before any more foreign powers could be dragged into the conflict, and somehow peace was re-established.  But for the countries most involved in the war, things will never be the same again.  Ancient cities have been flattened, and huge regions will now be incapable of supporting life for thousands of years.

Find the destination cards for all the cities that were nuked, tear them up, and remove them from the game.  Any player whose home marker is in one of these cities must move it to an adjacent city now.

Stick the following labels to the Rules Sheet:

> Cities labelled with a green sticker are Nuked.  You may not travel into or through a nuked city, by any method, ever.

> After destination cards are distributed, any that are totally inaccessible may be swapped for another card of the same colour.

Now continue play as normal, starting to the left of the player who acted as the rogue state.

Shuffle the enclosed Event card into the Event decks, without looking at it.

### Cards to include ###
- (E) **Chernobyl Disaster**: This city is nuked.  Stick a green sticker on it and move to an adjacent city.

_Breakup of..._

Throughout the many years of this multi-ethnic, multi-cultural country's existence, various peoples and regions have longed for control over their own destiny, as they once had.  Now, triggered by an economic crisis, several factions have risen up and are demanding independence.  The government response has been swift and brutal, and the country has entered a state of civil war, with the rule of law breaking down almost entirely.

Stick the following labels to the Rules Sheet, and fill in the blanks with the name of the country you are currently in:
> ______ is at civil war.  Travelling into a city that is or was in ______ costs one additional movement point, even if you are just passing through. [F]

> Each time a player hands in a destination card in a city that is or was in ______, that player rolls a die.  On a 6, the civil war is over and you should open Envelope C.  On any other number, the country you are in splits. [F]

> When a country *splits*, draw a line through it in permanent marker, with half the cities on one side and half the cities on the other (or as near as possible).  These are now two totally separate countries, and border rules apply. [F]

> Each new country could be split again on a later turn.  If a country has only one city, it cannot be split. [F]

> The exact status of these countries will be determined once the war is over.  For now, they are part of the same faction as ______. [F]

_Former ______ Republics_

The civil war in this region is over!  Perhaps it ended before too long; perhaps there are now a *lot* of new countries for children to learn.

Cover up all the labels on the Rules Sheet marked [F] with the blank labels included here.  These countries will not split up any more.

It's time to give the new countries names!  One country should have the original country abbreviation that was marked on the board: this has the same name as the original country.  All the other countries should now be given names: think of some together, and write abbreviations for them on the board in black circles.  Now put a yellow sticker on all new countries to denote their non-aligned status.

Peace has come to this region, but things will never be quite as they were.

Look at the included Special Ability card, fill in the blank with the original name of the broken up country, and shuffle it into the Special Ability deck.

### Components to include ###
- (A) **Unionist**: You may travel between former ______ countries without border penalties, and regardless of faction.

_Journey Through Africa_

Despite what you'd think from the map, North Africa isn't just a man walking through the desert with a camel.  It's a remarkable region full of cities, culture and history, with links to Europe that predate the Roman Empire.  In today's international world, journeying through Europe isn't enough for many travellers, and the next destination on everyone's mind is Africa.

Each player adds one city to the North coast of Africa.  To do this:
- Draw a dot with permanent marker on the North African coast and write a name next to it.
- Draw a sea route from your city to a European coastal city.
- Take one of the enclosed blank destination cards, and fill it in with the city's name, grid location, and picture.  You don't need to put a special event on the back.

These cities are part of the African Union, which acts as one non-aligned country covering the whole continent.  Mark it now by writing the letters "AU" in a black circle and adding a yellow sticker.

Stick the following label to the Rules Sheet:
> At the beginning of the game, when each player is dealt 3 yellow destination cards, deal one African destination card as well, to make a draft of 4 cards in total.

Shuffle the enclosed cards into the appropriate decks, without looking at them.

### Cards to include ###
- (A) **Bedouin**: You may travel from an African city to any other African city for a movement cost of 1.

- (E) **African Infrastructure**: Each player adds one road or sea route connecting two African cities
- (E) **African City**: Create a new African city connected to another African city via a road or sea route.  Make a destination card to go with it.

_(Include at least 6 blank destination cards)_
