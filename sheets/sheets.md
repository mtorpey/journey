# Journey Through Europe: Legacy #

A game for 3--6 players

This box contains everything you need to play _Journey Through Europe: Legacy_, a customised version of the original board game _Journey Through Europe_ that changes each time you play, permanently affecting the rules, board and story.

You may want to play multiple times with the same group of players; however, if some players leave or new players join between games, this shouldn't be a problem.  The game should be playable with only 2 players, but 3--6 is recommended.  The full saga should last around 12 games, and you will be left with dramatically changed rules and a board quite different from anything Ravensburger intended.

New rules and features will be introduced over time through the envelopes that are included.  When you open an envelope, read the instructions on the folded piece of paper inside, but don't look at anything else unless instructed to!

Start by reading the original rules and playing a game of _Journey Through Europe_.  As soon as you're finished, write the name of the winner on the Rules Sheet in the Hall of Fame, then open Envelope A and follow the instructions inside!

# Clarifications #

Some of the original rules of _Journey Through Europe_ are a little unclear.  We've made some of the ambiguities clear, so that in the Legacy version you always know exactly what you're supposed to be doing.  If anything is unclear, check below:

- A ``route'' will be defined as a line linking 2 cities on the board (not passing through any others).  Some are road routes, some are sea routes.
- You can stop moving before moving the full number you rolled, or even make no move at all.
- Your destination cards are public and should be clearly displayed.
- You shouldn't look at the instructions on your destination cards until you reach the destination.
- The phrase ``Move on x cities'' means you should take another turn assuming a roll of x.
- If you roll, you can still choose to do sea travel instead.
- Sea routes are dashed, land routes are solid.  Dover--Calais is a land route.
- The dealer is determined randomly.
- You don't play for runners up, you just finish when the first person finishes.
- ``not backwards and forwards in the same go'': if a player follows a route, they may not follow it in the opposite direction until their next turn.
- If you roll a six, your extra turn counts as a brand new turn.
- You may hand in a destination card just by passing through the city, without stopping; only on _places of interest_ do you have to stop moving.
- The Faroe islands are in Denmark.

# New Rules #

Europe has never stood still, and neither do the rules of _Journey Through Europe: Legacy_.  Included in this envelope are several Rules cards.  Don't look at these cards yet!  Shuffle them (gently) and keep them available as a deck.

At various times, you will draw new Rules cards from the deck, and carry out their instructions.  This will usually include adding new rules to the Rules Sheet (included in the box) by sticking a label to it.  Rules that are visible on the Rules Sheet are additional rules that you have to follow when playing.

Start by sticking the following label to the Rules Sheet:

\sticky{}

To get you started, draw **two** Rules cards right now, and stick their labels to the Rules Sheet or follow their instructions.

Stick the following label to the Rules sheet as well:

# Characters #

No two travellers are the same, and from now on you will play as unique characters that gain traits as your story progresses.

First, this envelope contains some Rules cards.  Shuffle them carefully into the deck of Rules cards, without looking at them.  This envelope also contains some Special Ability cards: shuffle them (gently) without looking at them, and keep them available as a deck.

Next, examine the Character Sheets included in this envelope.  Take the one that corresponds to your piece colour from the last game, and give the character a name.

Stick the following labels to your Rules Sheet:

# Global Warming #

Now you've done it.

Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, fuelled by Western innovations, CO~2~ levels in our atmosphere have been rising.  Scientists have warned for years of the dangers of climate change and rising sea levels, but you did nothing to slow your reckless consumption of fossil fuels.  Now rising temperatures have caused a huge CO~2~ pocket in the Greenland ice sheet to open, and what was happening gradually has now happened all at once.  The world will never be the same.

Look through the red destination cards that aren't in use at the moment, examining them one at a time, until you have found 5 coastal cities.  Do this again for yellow, and then for green, so that you have a total of 15 coastal cities.  Tear all these cards in half, and remove them from the game permanently.  Using a permanent marker, draw a black cross through each of these cities on the game board.  All these cities are now underwater, and are completely inaccessible.

Add the following labels to the Rules Sheet:

Any player currently in a flooded city evacuates to the nearest unflooded city.

All players vote on which one of the following two labels should be added to the Rules Sheet:

# High Speed Rail #

If God had meant for us to fly, he never would have given us the railways.  As newer, more efficient engines are invented, and the infrastructure of Europe develops to become more connected, a new generation of high-speed railways is appearing, and making flight almost obselete for short-to-medium distances.

Right now, each player should look at their home city, and choose a path starting at that city that follows 3 road routes.  For example, if your home city is Paris, you might choose the route Paris--Dijon--Lyons--Marseilles.  Build a railway on your chosen route, by using a permanent marker to cross it with several short perpendicular lines, like this:

# The Iron Curtain #

``From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent.  Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe.''

--- Winston Churchill, 1946

In the winter of 1982, Europe is a continent divided.  In the East looms the spectre of Communism; the Warsaw Pact has solidified the dominance of Marxist--Leninist doctrine, and formalised Moscow's tight control over its puppet states.  In the West, the combined forces of capitalist democracy, backed by the US, have formed a nuclear treaty known as NATO, in order to project their own power, and to stop any more nations falling to revolution or the Red Army.  Only a few states remain neutral, and have formed the Non-Aligned Movement in order to commit themselves to peace, and thus preserve their independence.  A tense state of Cold War has existed for decades.

Every country on the board is now part of one of three factions: NATO, the Warsaw Pact (WP), and ``non-aligned''.  Take the stickers included in this envelope, and stick one on the board right next to each oval-shaped country code, using the following factions:

NATO (blue stickers):

  - B (Belgium)
  - D (West Germany)
  - DK (Denmark)
  - F (France)
  - GB (United Kingdom)
  - GR (Greece)
  - I (Italy)
  - IS (Iceland)
  - L (Luxembourg)
  - N (Norway)
  - NL (Netherlands)
  - P (Portugal)
  - TR (Turkey)

WP (red stickers):

  - BG (Bulgaria)
  - CS (Czechoslovakia)
  - DDR (East Germany)
  - H (Hungary)
  - PL (Poland)
  - R (Romania)
  - SU (Soviet Union)

Non-aligned (yellow stickers):

  - A (Austria)
  - AL (Albania)
  - CH (Switzerland)
  - E (Spain)
  - IRL (Ireland)
  - S (Sweden)
  - SF (Finland)
  - YU (Yugoslavia)

# The Fall of Communism #

After 45 years of cold war with the United States and NATO, the Eastern Bloc is exhausted.  The centralised economy, spiralling military spending, and a failure to keep up with the West technologically have created the backdrop to the collapse of an empire.  Beginning with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the people of Eastern Europe rise up, and one by one, the states of the Warsaw Pact fall to popular revolution.  Even the Soviet Union itself faces collapse, as communism loses the breath in its lungs, and democracy and free-market capitalism finally dominate the continent.  In the post-Soviet world, NATO's relevance begins to wane, as a new European structure emerges: the European Union.

The Warsaw Pact no longer exists.  All WP countries immediately become non-aligned -- add yellow stickers to them now.  Turkey also becomes non-aligned -- add a yellow sticker to it too.

Blue stickers now denote EU members, while yellow stickers denote non-members.

Stick the following labels to the Rules Sheet, covering all the labels marked with [B]:

# The Fall of Capitalism #

After 45 years of cold war against the Eastern Bloc, the West is exhausted.  Market chaos, spiralling military spending, and a failure to keep up with the Soviets in living standards have created the backdrop to the fall of an ideology.  Socialist parties across the West have made unprecedented gains, and desparate attempts to crush the Left have only turned the people further against the establishment.  General strikes have taken hold across Western Europe, bringing government after government to their knees.  Even the United States has been forced to capitulate to Communist elements from within, and its very existence is uncertain as civil unrest causes several states to begin to secede.  In the chaos, the USSR begins what it calls a peacekeeping mission in Alaska, with the embattled Washington powerless to stop them.

With its superpower gone, NATO is defunct, the market economy is discredited, and democracy itself begins to slip away.  In this post-capitalist Europe, Moscow acts more boldly, and begins to describe the Warsaw Pact openly as what it has always been in secret: a Soviet Empire.

NATO no longer exists.  All NATO countries immediately become non-aligned -- add yellow stickers to them now.

Red stickers now denote the Soviet Empire, while yellow stickers denote the countries that remain non-aligned.

# Rogue State #

A regime change in this country has taken the world by surprise.  Nobody expected the recent elections to deliver such radical results, and now hopes of a return to normality have been dashed as extreme paramilitaries sieze the capital in a military coup.  With the alleged support of the people, the new regime declares a state of emergency, executing former leaders, seizing property, and beginning a weapons programme unprecedented in the modern age.  All borders are closed, and foreign governments look on with apprehension.

Put a red sticker on the country you are currently in, replacing its yellow or blue sticker.  Stick the following labels to the Rules Sheet:

Fill in the blank on the label with a number computed as follows: 30 divided by the number of cities in this country, rounded up.

# Missile Crisis #

Tensions have been growing between this rogue communist state and its neighbours, and hopes of a nuclear agreement were dashed when a recent summit ended in furious disagreement and threats of war.  Foreign diplomats and journalists have been evacuated, and the rogue government has cut off all communications from this country to the outside world.  EU states have their militaries on high alert, and watch on with bated breath.

Now, without warning, tanks have crossed the border from this country into its neighbour, in a full-blown invasion.  To begin with, the nations of the EU can only watch in amazement.  But as stories emerge of the invaders' brutal efficiency and their weapons plans, the major powers find themselves unable to stay out of the conflict, and their fingers creep slowly towards the red button.

Read these rules fully before taking any actions.

Each player takes the role of a state:

- The player who triggered this envelope takes the role of the rogue state, and chooses a bordering state to invade.
- Any player who is currently in a non-invaded EU state takes the role of that state (unless it contains more than one player).
- Each remaining player chooses any non-invaded EU state they like, going clockwise from the left of the rogue state player.

The rogue player faces off against the allied EU players in a nuclear war.  All players take nuclear weapons tokens (red cubes) from the box as follows:

- The rogue player takes a number equal to the number of players in the game, plus 2.
- Each other player takes 3.

Each player now distributes their weapons among the cities in their country as they choose.  The rogue player may also use cities in the invaded country.

The rogue state and the EU now take turns firing nuclear missiles at each other.  First the rogue player, then an EU player, then the rogue player, and so on.

On a player's turn:

- First, the player chooses one of the weapons in their territory to fire, and removes it from the board.
- They choose a city to fire on, and write it down secretly.
- Each player on the opposing side may now choose to move **one** weapon along a single road or sea route, to another city in their own territory that has not previously been nuked.
- The attacking player now reveals the city they wrote down, and the missile lands there.
- Put a green sticker on the nuked city.
- If the nuked city contained any weapons, they are destroyed and removed from the board, and the attacking player may hand one destination card (not their home city) to the player who controls the nuked city.
- If the nuked city did not contain a weapon, then this was a misfire, and as compensation, the player who controls the nuked city gets an additional weapon which they may add to any non-nuked city in their country.

Each time it is the EU's turn, a player is chosen randomly from among all EU players who still have weapons to use.  This can be done using dice.  The chosen player takes their turn as above,  and other EU players wait for a future turn.

If a city containing a player's piece is hit by a missile, they die and their playing piece is moved back to their home city.

The war ends when one side has run out of weapons.

If the rogue player ran out first, then the Rogue Communist State becomes non-aligned.
If the EU ran out first, then put a red sticker on the invaded country, which is now a puppet.
If both sides ran out on the same turn, then neither of these things happens.

Stick the following blank label over the label marked [D]:

\sticky{}

After the war is over, remove all remaining weapons from the board and open Envelope P.

# Nuclear Fallout #

The world's first nuclear war ended, thankfully, before things went too far.  One side's nuclear arsenal was depleted before any more foreign powers could be dragged into the conflict, and somehow peace was re-established.  But for the countries most involved in the war, things will never be the same again.  Ancient cities have been flattened, and huge regions will now be incapable of supporting life for thousands of years.

Find the destination cards for all the cities that were nuked, tear them up, and remove them from the game.  Any player whose home marker is in one of these cities must move it to an adjacent city now.

Stick the following labels to the Rules Sheet:

\sticky{}

\sticky{}

Now continue play as normal, starting to the left of the player who acted as the rogue state.

# Breakup of... #

Throughout the many years of this multi-ethnic, multi-cultural country's existence, various peoples and regions have longed for control over their own destiny, as they once had.  Now, triggered by an economic crisis, several factions have risen up and are demanding independence.  The government response has been swift and brutal, and the country has entered a state of civil war, with the rule of law breaking down almost entirely.

Stick the following labels to the Rules Sheet, and fill in the blanks with the name of the country you are currently in:

# Former \blankcountry{} Republics #

The civil war in this region is over!  Perhaps it ended before too long; perhaps there are now a *lot* of new countries for European schoolchildren to learn.

Cover up all the labels on the Rules Sheet marked [F] with the blank labels included here.  These countries will not split up any more.

It's time to give the new countries names!  One country should have an oval-shaped country abbreviation that was already printed on the board: this has the same name as the original country.  All the other countries should now be given names: think of some together, and write abbreviations for them on the board in black circles.  Now put a yellow sticker on all new countries to denote their non-aligned status.

Peace has come to this region, but things will never be quite as they were.

Look at the included Special Ability card, fill in the blank with the original name of the broken up country, and shuffle it into the Special Ability deck.

# Journey Through Africa #

Despite what you'd think from the map, North Africa isn't just a man walking through the desert with a camel.  It's a remarkable region full of cities, culture and history, with links to Europe that predate the Roman Empire.  In today's international world, journeying through Europe isn't enough for many travellers, and the next destination on everyone's mind is Africa.

Each player adds one city to the North coast of Africa.  To do this:

- Draw a dot with permanent marker on the North African coast and write a name next to it.
- Draw a sea route from your city to a European coastal city.
- Take one of the enclosed blank destination cards, and fill it in with the city's name, grid location, and picture.  You don't need to put a special event on the back.

These cities are part of the African Union, which acts as one non-aligned country covering the whole continent.  Mark it now by writing the letters ``AU'' in a black circle and adding a yellow sticker.

Stick the following label to the Rules Sheet:
