# Journey Through Europe: Legacy #

This document contains instructions for preparing a "legacy" version of the board game _Journey Through Europe_.  By "legacy", we mean an extended version of the game that changes each time you play, permanently affecting the rules, board and story.

Preparation mainly consists of writing cards and labels and sealing them in envelopes for the players to open at the appropriate times.  The rules are not revealed to players at the beginning, but are added gradually over about 10 games.

If you want to play without spoilers, **stop reading now**.  Ask a friend who doesn't want to play, or who doesn't care about spoilers, to follow these instructions for you.



## What you'll need ##

## Introduction ##
_(Print on A5 and put at the top, so it's the first thing players see when they open the box)_

_Journey Through Europe: Legacy_

A game for 3--6 players

This box contains everything you need to play _Journey Through Europe: Legacy_, a customised version of the original board game _Journey Through Europe_ that changes each time you play, permanently affecting the rules, board and story.

You may want to play multiple times with the same group of players; however, if some players leave or new players join between games, this shouldn't be a problem.  The game should be playable with only 2 players, but 3--6 is recommended.  The full saga should last around 12 games, and you will be left with a dramatically changed game, and a board quite different from anything Ravensburger intended.

New rules and features will be introduced over time through the envelopes that are included.  When you open an envelope, read the instructions on the folded piece of paper inside, but don't look at anything else unless instructed to!

Start by reading the original rules and playing a game of _Journey Through Europe_.  As soon as you're finished, write the name of the winner on the Rules sheet, then open envelope A and follow the instructions inside!



## Clarifications ##
_(Print on A5 and include next to original rulebook)_

Some of the original rules of _Journey Through Europe_ are a little unclear.  We've made some of the ambiguities clear, so that in the Legacy version you always know exactly what you're supposed to be doing.  If anything is unclear, check below:
- A "route" will be defined as a single line linking 2 cities on the board (not passing through any others).
- You can stop moving before moving the full number you rolled, or even make no move at all.
- Your destination cards are public and should be clearly displayed.
- You shouldn't look at the instructions on your destination cards until you reach the destination.
- "Move on x cities" means "Take another turn assuming a roll of x".
- If you roll, you can still choose to do sea travel instead.
- Sea routes are dashed, land routes are solid.  Dover--Calais is a land route.
- The dealer is determined randomly.
- You don't play for runners up, you just finish when the first person finishes.
- "not backwards and forwards in the same go": if a player follows a route, they may not follow it in the opposite direction until their next turn.
- If you roll a six, your extra turn counts as a brand new turn.
- You may hand in a destination card just by passing through the city, without stopping; only on _places of interest_ do you have to stop moving.
- The Faroe islands are in Denmark.



## Envelope A ##
_New Rules_

Europe has never stood still, and neither do the rules of _Journey Through Europe: Legacy_.  Included in this envelope are several Rules cards.  Don't look at these cards yet!  Shuffle them (gently) and keep them available.

At various times, you will draw new Rules cards from the deck, and carry out their instructions.  This will usually include adding new rules to the Rules sheet (included in the box) by sticking a label to it.  Rules that are visible on the Rules sheet are additional rules that you have to follow when playing.

Start by sticking the label below to the Rules sheet:
- At the end of each game, select 2 Rules cards (or as many as are available), follow their instructions, and then destroy them.

It's the end of a game right now, so go ahead and draw 2 Rules cards immediately!

- (R) **Faster ships**: Sea routes work the same as land routes, but cost 2 points.
- (R) **Drafting destinations**: Instead of dealing destinations randomly, distribute them with 3 drafts.
  - Determine home cities as normal.
  - Deal 3 red cards to each player: each player chooses one and passes the rest to their left, repeatedly until each player has chosen 3 cards.
  - Do the same for green cards, and then for yellow.
  - No looking at the instructions on the backs of cards!
- (R) **Borders**: Moving from one country to another costs 1 additional movement point (even on ships and planes)
- (R) **Characters**: Open Envelope ENV_CHARACTERS.
- (R) **Footprint**: Open Envelope ENV_GLOBALWARMING1.



## Envelope ENV_CHARACTERS ##
_Characters_

No two travellers are the same, and from now on you will play as unique characters that gain traits as your story progresses.

First, this envelope contains some Rules cards.  Shuffle them carefully into the deck of Rules cards.

Next, examine the Character Sheets included in this envelope.  Take the one that corresponds to your piece colour from the last game, and give the character a name.  Then take the Special Ability cards (included in this deck) without looking at them, shuffle them (gently) and keep them available.

Stick the following label(s) to your Rules sheet:
- At the beginning of each game, each player chooses a character, clockwise starting with the player to the left of the dealer (do this after home cities are determined, but before other destinations are distributed).  This character determines your special abilities and piece colour for the game.
- If you have more players than usual, you may need to create a new character.  If it is your turn to choose a character, but all Character Sheets have already been chosen, take an unused Character Sheet from the box, give it a name, and take Special Abilities equal to the number on each other character, plus one.  Choose one card to return to the deck, and stick the rest to the new Character Sheet.
- At the end of each _even-numbered_ game, draw and reveal a number of Special Ability cards equal to the number of players in the game.  Each player chooses one and sticks it to their Character Sheet.  The order is determined by how many destination cards remain in the players' hand, starting with the player with the most cards and finishing with the player that has won the game and therefore has zero.  If some players have the same number, priority goes to the player whose home is furthest north.  Any unused characters for this game get an extra Special Ability from the deck at random.
- Characters may only have 4 special abilities.  If you already have 4, then choose new Special Abilities as normal, but players may choose to either stick their new ability over an old one, or to return it to the deck unused.
- If there are fewer Special Abilities in the deck than players, then do not take new Special Abilities.

If this was an even-numbered game, then take new Special Ability cards as described now!

- (R) **Events**: Open Envelope ENV_EVENTS.
- (R) **The Iron Curtain**: Open Envelope ENV_IRONCURTAIN.



## Envelope ENV_EVENTS ##
_Events_

Sometimes when travelling, unexpected things happen.  Whatever plans you make, you can count on something going wrong, and this game is no different!

This envelope contains a whole load of Event cards.  Don't look at these just yet, but shuffle them and put them in a pile next to the board face-down.  Add the following label(s) to the Rules Sheet:
- If a player rolls a 6, and then when rolling for their extra turn they get another 6, they do not move, but immediately draw and read out an Event card, following its instructions.  Then play passes to the next player.
- Return used Event cards to the bottom of the deck, unless otherwise instructed.
- Shuffle the Event deck at the beginning of each game.

More Event cards may be added as you open other envelopes!

This envelope also contains one Rules card.  Shuffle it carefully into the deck of Rules cards.

- (R) **High Speed Rail**: Open Envelope ENV_RAIL.


## Envelope ENV_GLOBALWARMING1 ##
_Footprint_

Add the following label to the board somewhere in the North Sea:
- (Picture of a thermometer composed of 100 boxes) When all boxes are filled, open Envelope ENV_GLOBALWARMING2.

And add the following label to the Rules Sheet:
- Each time a player takes a flight, fill in one box with initials identifying that player's character. (ENV_GLOBALWARMING1)



## Envelope ENV_GLOBALWARMING2 ##
_Global Warming_

Now you've done it.

Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, fuelled by Western innovations, CO~2~ levels in our atmosphere have been rising.  Scientists have warned for years of the dangers of climate change and rising sea levels, but you did nothing to slow your reckless consumption of fossil fuels.  Now rising temperatures have caused a huge CO~2~ pocket in the Greenland ice sheet to open, and what was happening gradually has now happened all at once.  The world will never be the same.

Look through the red destination cards that aren't in use at the moment, examining them one at a time, until you have found 5 coastal cities.  Do this again for yellow, and then for green, so that you have a total of 15 coastal cities.  Tear all these cards in half, and remove them from the game permanently.  Using a permanent marker, draw a black cross through each of these cities on the game board.  All these cities are now underwater, and are completely inaccessible.

Add the following label(s) to the Rules Sheet:
- No player may stop in a city that is flooded (marked with a cross).
- All roads entering a flooded city are now considered sea routes, and any railways on the route are unusable.
- You may only travel through a flooded city if you have enough movement points to move into it and back out of it again, via sea routes, on the same turn.
- You may not fly to a flooded city.

Any player currently in a flooded city evacuates to the nearest unflooded city.

Examine the boxes on the thermometer to see which character took the most flights.  Stick the following label to their character sheet, in the area marked "Leave this area blank":
- **Polluter**: TODO

All players vote on which of the following two labels should be added to the Rules Sheet over the label marked (ENV_GLOBALWARMING1) :
- Each player may take only one flight per game.
- Each time a player takes a flight, they must draw one additional destination card which they must fulfil before completing the game.

Stick the most popular one to the sheet, and destroy the other.  If the vote is tied, choose randomly.



## Envelope ENV_RAIL ##
_High Speed Rail_

If God had meant for us to fly, he never would have given us the railways.  As newer, more efficient engines are invented, and the infrastructure of Europe develops to become more connected, a new generation of high-speed railways is appearing, and making flight almost obselete for short-to-medium distances.

Right now, each player should look at their home city, and choose a path starting at that city that follows 3 road routes.  For example, if your home city is Paris, you might choose the route Paris--Dijon--Lyons--Marseilles.  Build a railway on your chosen route, by using a permanent marker to cross it with several short perpendicular lines, like this:

Now stick the following label to the Rules Sheet:
- Moving along a rail route (crossed with black lines) costs only half a point of movement.

Add the enclosed cards to the Event deck and Special Abilities deck as appropriate.

- (A) **Railroad tycoon**: When moving by road away from a rail-connected city, add rail along the first route you take
- (E) **HS3**: Add a new length-3 railway anywhere in this country (or as long as possible).
- (E) **Leaves on the line**: For the rest of the game, moving along a rail route costs 2 movement points instead of half a movement point.  This applies to everyone.



## Envelope ENV_IRONCURTAIN ##
_The Iron Curtain_

"From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent.  Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe."

--- Winston Churchill, 1946

In the winter of 1982, Europe is a continent divided.  In the East, the spectre of Communism looms large; the Warsaw Pact has solidified the dominance of Marxist--Leninist doctrine, and formalised Moscow's tight control over its puppet states.  In the West, the combined forces of capitalist democracy, backed by the US, have formed a nuclear treaty known as NATO, in order to project their own power, and to stop any more nations falling to revolution or the Red Army.  Only a few states remain neutral, and have formed the Non-Aligned Movement in order to commit themselves to peace, and thus preserve their independence.  A tense state of Cold War has existed for decades.

Every country on the board is now part of one of three factions: NATO, the Warsaw Pact (WP), and "non-aligned".  Take the stickers included in this envelope, and stick one on the board right next to each oval-shaped country code, using the following factions:
- NATO (blue):
  - B (Belgium)
  - D (West Germany)
  - DK (Denmark)
  - F (France)
  - GB (United Kingdom)
  - GR (Greece)
  - I (Italy)
  - IS (Iceland)
  - L (Luxembourg)
  - N (Norway)
  - NL (Netherlands)
  - P (Portugal)
  - TR (Turkey)
- WP (red):
  - BG (Bulgaria)
  - CS (Czechoslovakia)
  - DDR (East Germany)
  - H (Hungary)
  - PL (Poland)
  - R (Romania)
  - SU (Soviet Union)
- Non-aligned (yellow):
  - A (Austria)
  - AL (Albania)
  - CH (Switzerland)
  - E (Spain)
  - IRL (Ireland)
  - S (Sweden)
  - SF (Finland)
  - YU (Yugoslavia)

Stick the following label to the Rules Sheet:
- You may not move directly between NATO countries (blue sticker) and WP countries (red sticker).  This includes flights and sea routes.  **Exception**: You may fly from West Germany to Berlin, but must then fly back to West Germany before any further movement. (ENV_IRONCURTAIN)

Add the following label to the board somewhere in the North Sea:
- (2 columns of 3 boxes, the left one marked with a dollar $, and the right one marked with a hammer-and-sickle ☭)

And add the following label to the Rules Sheet:
- At the end of each game, if the winner's home was in a NATO or WP country, put a cross in the corresponding column on the board.
- If all 3 NATO ($) boxes are filled, open Envelope ENV_NATOWINS.
- If all 3 WP (☭) boxes are filled, open Envelope ENV_WPWINS.
(ENV_IRONCURTAIN)

_(include all the blue, red and yellow stickers in this envelope)_



## Envelope ENV_NATOWINS ##
_The Fall of Communism_

After 45 years of cold war with the United States and NATO, the Eastern Bloc is exhausted.  The centralised economy, spiralling military spending, and a failure to keep up with the West technologically have created the backdrop to the collapse of an empire.  Beginning with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the people of Eastern Europe rise up, and one by one, the states of the Warsaw Pact fall to popular revolution.  Even the Soviet Union itself faces collapse, as communism loses the breath in its lungs, and democracy and free-market capitalism finally dominate the continent.  In the post-Soviet world, NATO's relevance begins to wane, as a new European structure emerges: the European Union.

The Warsaw Pact no longer exists.  All WP countries immediately become non-aligned -- add yellow stickers to them now.  Turkey also becomes non-aligned -- add a yellow sticker to it too.

Blue stickers now denote EU members, while yellow stickers denote non-members.

Stick the following labels to the Rules Sheet over the two labels marked with (ENV_IRONCURTAIN):
- There is no border penalty for moving between EU countries (blue stickers).
- Each time you hand in a destination card in a non-EU country (yellow sticker) that borders at least two EU countries, roll the die: on a 6, this country joins the EU.
