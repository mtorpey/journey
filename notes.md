# Journey Through Europe: Legacy (notes) #

Notes for creating an extended version of the game with:
- better balance (initially)
- more options for players
- an evolving game where a session may change the game board/rules permanently

## Clarifications
Some aspects of the original rules are unclear.  These should be made concrete.
- You can stop moving early, or even make no move at all.
- Each player's destinations are public and should be clearly displayed.
- You shouldn't look at the destination instructions in advance
- "Move on x cities" means "Take another turn assuming a roll of x".
- If you roll, you can still choose to do sea travel instead.
- Sea routes are dashed, land routes are solid.  Dover--Calais is a land route.
- Determine dealer randomly
- You don't play for runners up
- Make "back and forth" explicit
- Faroe islands are in Denmark
- Ambiguous card instructions:
  * "next turn" could be the turn you take immediately if you rolled a 6

## Simple improvements
Things that just make the game better, and should probably already be in.  Introduce these early via cards.
- Faster ships: sea routes work the same as land routes, but cost 2 points.
- Drafting destinations: random home, place pins, then several drafts of location cards.
  * A 3-card draft for each colour
  * No looking at destination effects!
- Borders: costs 1 extra point to move between countries

## Big new mechanics
Important features that might dramatically change the game.  Introduce these over time.

### Character cards
- Choose a character each game
- Fun name -- make up names yourself?
- Bound to piece colours
- Special powers
  * One initially
  * More added later
  * Chosen
- Add early: maybe even for game 2

### Event cards
- Stack available on table
- Draw one if you roll a double-6
- Add early

### Global Warming
- Big thermometer on board
- Add a mark each time a player flies
- When the counter reaches 100 (or so) a CO~2~ pocket in Greenland is released
- Many coastal cities are removed from the game
- Replace some routes with sea routes
- Add early

### High Speed Rail
- Permanent special routes added to board
- Faster to move along
  * half a point per move?
- ~~Some restriction: have to stay on until reaching an end?~~
- Initially, each player puts down a length-3 railway
- Expand railways over time
- Special powers:
  * Railroad tycoon: when moving by road away from a rail-connected city, add rail along the first route you take
- Extra event cards:
  * HS3: add a new length-3 railway anywhere in this country (or as long as possible)
  * Leaves on the line: For the rest of the game, moving on railways costs 2 per route instead of ½ per route

### The Iron Curtain
- Countries divided into 3 factions:
  * NATO
  * Warsaw Pact (WP)
  * Non-aligned (incl. Yugoslavia and Albania)
- Small sticker for each country
- Cannot move directly between NATO and WP countries
  * Special case for West Berlin
- If a NATO or WP player wins a game, add 1 to that faction's score
- When a faction's score reaches 3, they win the Cold War

### Fall of Communism
- All WP countries become non-aligned
- Turkey becomes non-aligned
- NATO becomes EU
- No border penalty between EU countries
- Hand in a card in a country bordering two EU countries: roll to join

### Fall of Capitalism
- All NATO countries become non-aligned
- WP becomes Global Communist Utopia (GCU)
- Each player has to visit Moscow in each game as if they had it as a destination card
- At end of game, take all non-aligned cards that were handed in, and pick 2 to be invaded (they become GCU)

### From the Ashes
- The defeated faction may rise again and trigger nuclear war

### Breakup of...
- Choose a random(ish) card - that country has a civil war and begins to break up
- Movement is impaired in the country (lower of two rolls?)
- When a player hands in a card here, they roll a die
  * 6: the war ends
  * otherwise: split this country into two countries 
  * equal number of cities (or as close as possible)
  * draw the border in permanent marker
  * both countries are at civil war
  * both countries are non-aligned

### Journey through Africa
- Add cities to North African coast
  * Players add one each - create card (no special event) and add to map
  * Sea routes connecting each one to Europe
- The African Union acts as one country covering the whole continent, and is non-aligned.  Mark it now with "AU" and a yellow sticker.
- One African city dealt to each player with yellow cards
- Extra event cards
  * African Infrastructure: each player adds one road or sea route connecting two African cities
  * African City: make a new city

## New decks
These decks will be added to the game:
- New rules -- sticker for rulesheet, or instruction to open envelope.
- Character abilities -- stickers for character cards.
- Events -- big things that happen

### Character abilities
These are added to characters over time.  Perhaps 1 for each player after a game, but hand out in order of how many destinations you have left.
- Private yacht: you may move along the coast by 1 city as if it were a sea route.
  * give examples
- Olympian: you may move immediately to Athens instead of a normal turn.
- Viking: you may move immediately to Reykjavík instead of a normal turn.
- Hare: rolls of 5 or 6 are doubled, but rolls of 1--4 count for 0.
- Tortoise: ignore and reroll all 6s, but get an extra turn when you roll a 1.
- Black cat: if you roll a 1, you may ignore it and reroll; if the new roll is also a 1, take an event card.
- Commander: if you roll a 1, make your move and then move another player 1 city by road (ignoring any movement penalties).
- Interpol: if you move into or through a city occupied by another player, you may move that player to your home city.
- Frequent flyer: flights cost 1 less
- Hajji: land routes going southeast cost only half a point
  * single land routes where end city is both down *and* right of start city
  * e.g. Trondheim--Sundsvall, Naples--Messina
- Diplomat: can move between NATO and WP countries
- American tourist: only visits one city in each country or can't stay anywhere more than one turn

- Hipster: won't visit anywhere someone has been before
- Seasick: can't travel by sea
- Lonely backpacker: follows around players they encounter for 2 turns
- Late planner: when handing in 5th destination, may trade one destination card to the bank for a random of the same colour

- Revolutionary: once per game, you may change the faction of the country you are in to that of a neighbouring country
- Off-duty pilot: can fly for free once per game
- Cuckoo: can kick player out of city to neighbouring one
- Speedboat salesman: can move through flooded cities (but not end turn there)
- Crow: travels 'as the crow flies'
- Holiday romance: opposite of backpacker. Drags other player around for 2 turns.
- Rockstar: you may choose (before rolling) to double your roll, but the player to your left then rolls and moves for you afterwards.

### Event cards
If you roll a double-6, draw one and resolve it immediately, instead of moving.
- Lost luggage: have to go back to previous city to pick it up?

- Eurovision Song Contest: your current country has won!  Add 1 to all rolls made in this country and its neighbours (who all voted for it) for the rest of the game
- Flight diverted: each player passes 2 destination cards to the player on their left.
  * Don't have 2?  Just pass 1.
- Redistribution of wealth: all destination cards from all players shuffled together and dealt out clockwisse (starting to left of current player) (* Fall of Capitalism)
- Capitalism is unfair: whoever has fewest destination cards gives one to another player. (* Fall of Communism)
  * If tied, all tied players do so.
- Pandemic 
  * Each time *you* end your turn in a city, place a disease token there
  * Each time *another* player moves into or through an infected city, you get an extra movement point on your next turn
