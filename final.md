# Journey Through Europe: Legacy #

This document contains instructions for preparing a "legacy" version of the board game _Journey Through Europe_.  By "legacy", we mean an extended version of the game that changes each time you play, permanently affecting the rules, board and story. 

Preparation mainly consists of writing cards and labels and sealing them in envelopes for the players to open at the appropriate times.  The rules are not revealed to players at the beginning, but are added gradually over about 10 games.

If you want to play without spoilers, **stop reading now**.  Ask a friend who doesn't want to play, or who doesn't care about spoilers, to follow these instructions for you.



## What you'll need ##

- Blank white cards
- _y_-inch labels
- Red, blue and yellow stickers (little round ones)

_Print on A5 and put at the top, so it's the first thing players see when they open the box.

_Journey Through Europe: Legacy_

A game for 3--6 players

This box contains everything you need to play _Journey Through Europe: Legacy_, a customised version of the original board game _Journey Through Europe_ that changes each time you play, permanently affecting the rules, board and story.

Find a group of friends who are prepared to play this game multiple times; however, if some players leave or new players join between games, this shouldn't be a problem.  The game should be playable with only 2 players, but 3--6 is recommended.  The full saga should last around 12 games, and you will be left with a dramatically changed game, and a board quite different from anything Ravensburger intended.

Start by reading the original rules and playing a game of _Journey Through Europe_.  As soon as you're finished, open envelope A and follow the instructions inside -- but don't look at any of the cards!



## Clarifications ##
_Print on A5 and include next to original rulebook_

Some of the original rules of _Journey Through Europe_ are a little unclear.  We've made some of the ambiguities clear, so that in the Legacy version you always know exactly what you're supposed to be doing.  If anything is unclear, check below:
- A "route" will be defined as a single line linking 2 cities on the board (not passing through any others).
- You can stop moving before moving the full number you rolled, or even make no move at all.
- Your destination cards are public and should be clearly displayed.
- You shouldn't look at the instructions on your destination cards until you reach the destination.
- "Move on x cities" means "Take another turn assuming a roll of x".
- If you roll, you can still choose to do sea travel instead.
- Sea routes are dashed, land routes are solid.  Dover--Calais is a land route.
- The dealer is determined randomly.
- You don't play for runners up, you just finish when the first person finishes.
- "not backwards and forwards in the same go": if a player follows a route, they may not follow it in the opposite direction until their next turn.
- If you roll a six, your extra turn counts as a brand new turn.
- You may hand in a destination card just by passing through the city, without stopping; only on _places of interest_ do you have to stop moving.
- The Faroe islands are in Denmark.



## Envelope A ##
_New Rules_

Europe has never stood still, and neither do the rules of _Journey Through Europe: Legacy_.  Included in this envelope are several Rules cards.  Don't look at these cards yet!  Shuffle them (gently) and keep them available.

At various times, you will draw new Rules cards from the deck, and carry out their instructions.  This will usually include adding new rules to the Rules sheet (included in the box) by sticking a label to it.  Rules that are visible on the Rules sheet are additional rules that you have to follow when playing.

Start by sticking the label below to the Rules sheet:
- At the end of each game, select 2 Rules cards (or as many as are available), and follow their instructions.

It's the end of a game right now, so go ahead and draw 2 Rules cards immediately!

- (R) **Faster ships**: sea routes work the same as land routes, but cost 2 points.
- (R) **Drafting destinations**: instead of dealing destinations randomly, distribute them with 3 drafts.
  - Determine home cities as normal.
  - Deal 3 red cards to each player: each player chooses one and passes the rest to their left, repeatedly until each player has chosen 3 cards.
  - Do the same for green cards, and then for yellow.
  - No looking at the instructions on the backs of cards!
- (R) **Borders**: moving from one country to another costs 1 additional movement point (even on ships and planes)
- (R) **Characters**: open Envelope ENV_CHARACTERS.



## Envelope ENV_CHARACTERS ##
_Characters_

No two travellers are the same, and from now on you will play as unique characters that gain traits as your story progresses.

Examine the Character Sheets included in this envelope.  Take the one that corresponds to your piece colour from the last game, and give the character a name.  Then take the Special Ability cards without looking at them, shuffle them (gently) and keep them available.

Stick the following label to your Rules sheet:
- At the end of
